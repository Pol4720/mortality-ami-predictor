Final project for the **Machine Learning** course in the last year of the **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science**.

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project focuses on developing predictive models for **in-hospital mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI)** using modern **machine learning techniques**.  
It also explores the prediction of **ventricular arrhythmias** in the hospital setting as a secondary task.

The study is based on a real clinical dataset of approximately **4,500 patients**, including demographic, clinical, laboratory, and electrocardiographic variables.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze and summarize the state of the art on AMI mortality prediction.
- Preprocess and model clinical data using ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks).
- Evaluate models through discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility metrics.
- Compare results against classical clinical scores (e.g., GRACE, TIMI).
- Ensure model interpretability using SHAP and LIME.

## 🛠️ Development & Testing

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12
- pip package manager

### Installation

```bash
cd Tools
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Running the Application

### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the full environment (Dashboard + Jupyter + MLflow).

```bash
# Run the application (Dashboard only)
cd Tools
make up

# Run in development mode (Dashboard + Jupyter + MLflow)
cd Tools
make dev

# Stop the application
cd Tools
make down
```

- **Dashboard**: <http://localhost:8501>
- **Jupyter Lab**: <http://localhost:8888> (dev mode only)
- **MLflow UI**: <http://localhost:5000> (dev mode only)

### Option 2: Local Python Environment

If you prefer running it directly with Python:

1. Ensure dependencies are installed (see Installation above).
2. Run the Streamlit dashboard:

```bash
cd Tools
streamlit run dashboard/Dashboard.py
```

### Running Tests

The project includes comprehensive unit tests to ensure code quality and reliability:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run tests with coverage
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test module
pytest tests/test_data_cleaning.py -v
```

### Continuous Integration
All code changes are automatically tested using GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline:
- ✅ Tests run on Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12
- ✅ Code quality checks (flake8, black, isort)
- ✅ Coverage reporting
- ✅ Automated on every push and pull request
