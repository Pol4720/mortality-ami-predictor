# Mortality-AMI-Predictor

Final project for the **Machine Learning** course in the last year of the **Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science**.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
This project focuses on developing predictive models for **in-hospital mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI)** using modern **machine learning techniques**.  
It also explores the prediction of **ventricular arrhythmias** in the hospital setting as a secondary task.

The study is based on a real clinical dataset of approximately **4,500 patients**, including demographic, clinical, laboratory, and electrocardiographic variables.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Analyze and summarize the state of the art on AMI mortality prediction.
- Preprocess and model clinical data using ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks).
- Evaluate models through discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility metrics.
- Compare results against classical clinical scores (e.g., GRACE, TIMI).
- Ensure model interpretability using SHAP and LIME.
