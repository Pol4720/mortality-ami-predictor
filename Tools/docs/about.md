# About

## Project Overview

The **Mortality AMI Predictor** is a comprehensive machine learning system designed to predict clinical outcomes in patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). The project combines modern ML techniques with clinical expertise to provide accurate, interpretable predictions for healthcare professionals.

## Mission

Our mission is to improve clinical decision-making and patient outcomes by providing:

- **Accurate predictions** of in-hospital mortality and ventricular arrhythmias
- **Interpretable models** that clinicians can trust and understand
- **Easy-to-use tools** that integrate into clinical workflows
- **Evidence-based approaches** validated through rigorous testing

## Key Features

### For Clinicians

- **Risk Stratification**: Identify high-risk patients early
- **Clinical Scores**: Compare ML predictions with established scores (GRACE, TIMI, Killip)
- **Interpretability**: Understand which factors contribute to each prediction
- **User-Friendly Interface**: No coding required - use the intuitive dashboard

### For Researchers

- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to extend and customize
- **Multiple Models**: Compare different ML algorithms

## Design Philosophy

### Modularity

Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility. This makes the code:

- **Easy to understand**: Small, focused files
- **Easy to test**: Isolated functionality
- **Easy to extend**: Add features without breaking existing code
- **Easy to maintain**: Changes are localized

### Type Safety

All functions include type hints for better:

- **IDE support**: Autocomplete and error detection
- **Documentation**: Clear parameter types
- **Reliability**: Catch errors before runtime

### Professional Patterns

We use proven design patterns:

- **Factory Pattern**: Create models dynamically
- **Strategy Pattern**: Swap algorithms easily
- **Builder Pattern**: Construct complex objects step-by-step
- **Singleton Pattern**: Manage global state
- **Registry Pattern**: Discover components automatically

## Research Background
